# SQL Bootcamp Practice

This repository is a collection of SQL exercises, concepts, and practice examples designed to enhance my understanding of SQL and data analysis techniques. It serves as a reference for learning and a record of my progress as I work through SQL fundamentals to advanced querying.

The goal is to master database operations such as data retrieval, aggregation, joins, filtering, and optimization techniques, all of which are fundamental for data analysts and business intelligence roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Concepts Covered:
- **Data Retrieval**: SELECT statements, filtering with WHERE
- **Sorting and Limiting Data**: ORDER BY, LIMIT
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
- **Set Operations**: UNION vs UNION ALL
- **Grouping and Aggregations**: GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries, correlated subqueries
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), etc.
- **SQL Optimization**: Query performance improvements (to be added)

## üìÅ Repository Structure:
The repository is organized by SQL topics, with each file corresponding to a particular concept or query exercise:
